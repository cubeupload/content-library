# CubeUpload Content Library
*A basic deduplicated filing structure for content*

## About
We store a *lot* of images on cubeupload and it gets messy on the filesystem. With this library we only store a single copy of each uploaded image and use a cache to resolve the user's filename to the corresponding hash.

## Usage
Nice and easy...

```php
// Initialise the class, giving it an instance of a Flysystem\Filesystem to work with.
$library = new CubeUpload\ContentLibrary\Library( $filesystem );

// Feed the write() method a file path. The file will be copied to the library and the hash returned.
$hash = $library->write( $filePath );
// Save the resulting hash to a cache or database for later resolution

// Load the content of a hashed file
$content = $library->read( $hash );

// Check if a hash exists in the library
$exists = $library->has( $hash );

// Delete the hash content in the library
$library->delete( $hash );
```

## Notes
There's likely better ways of storing a lot of images. Let us know.
